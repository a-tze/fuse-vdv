=======

This tool provides a FUSE based filesystems that enables you to virtually 
concatenate a sequence of files. Given the purpose of the tool, it works 
best with video files in "raw DV" format.

The tool is tuned for the needs of the FeM/VOC CRS project (URL to come 
once it's publicly released) which contains some more documentation.
